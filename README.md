# Random-HEX-color-generator

I've created a random hex color generator which generates random colors adding to that the background also changes with code generated.
Also you can observe that the text of hex-color code also changes according to the code.

<h3>Math.random().toString(16).substring(2, 8)</h3>

The above line is the key code of this JS program.

So basically what it does is:
It creates a random number and converts it into a hexadecimal string, then cuts down the string from index 2-8 with 2 inclusive and 8 exclusive.

Thank you
